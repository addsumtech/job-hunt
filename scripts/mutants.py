"""Mutation testing: break the code on purpose and see whether the suite notices.

Why this exists as a checked-in tool rather than a one-off measurement. On
2026-08-23 an audit generated 421 mutants against this repo and 98 of them
SURVIVED — the suite stayed green with the code deliberately broken — and the
survivors were concentrated exactly where the damage is highest: render_cv.py
32/64, check_claims.py 11/26, check_shortlist.py 8/46. Six content branches of
`build_latex` and four of `render_docx` could each be turned into `if False:`
with 1062 tests still passing.

A number measured once is a number that rots. What makes this actionable is the
BASELINE: the survivors known at the time are recorded in `mutants-baseline.json`
with a note each, and `--ci` fails only on survivors that are NOT in it. So the
existing debt does not block anyone, and a change that makes the suite blinder
than it already was does.

    exit 0  no new survivors
    exit 1  new survivors, printed one per line
    exit 2  could not run

Usage:
    python3 scripts/mutants.py --ci                 # the three highest-damage files
    python3 scripts/mutants.py --targets scripts/check_apply.py
    python3 scripts/mutants.py --targets ... --record   # rewrite the baseline

`--record` is deliberately not something CI can do: a harness that updates its own
baseline reports success by forgetting.
