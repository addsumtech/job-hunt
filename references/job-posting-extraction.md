# Job Posting Extraction Reference

How to read a job posting and turn it into a structured object that drives CV tailoring and the cover letter. Every step here is directly actionable — no guessing, no skipping.

---

## 0. Get the posting text reliably (before you extract anything)

Garbage in, garbage out: extracting from a page that isn't actually the posting produces fabricated requirements that then drive the whole application. So validate the source first.

- **A `200 OK` is not proof you have the posting.** LinkedIn, Workday, Greenhouse, Indeed, and most portals return a success status for a **login wall, cookie/consent banner, bot check, or search page**. If the fetched text has no responsibilities and no requirements, is dominated by "sign in" / "create account" / cookie text, or is suspiciously short, you did **not** get the posting.
- **When the fetch is thin or wrong, do not extract — ask the user to paste the full posting text.** Inventing must-haves off a login wall is worse than asking.
- **Terminal case:** if the posting genuinely can't be obtained (dead link, nothing to paste), stop and say so. Never proceed on guessed requirements.

## 1. The Extraction Schema

Extract exactly these fields. Populate each as described below.

| Field | Type | How to populate |
|---|---|---|
| `role_title` | string | The exact title as written in the posting (e.g. "Senior Data Engineer", "Machine Learning Engineer II"). |
| `company` | string | The exact public employer name as the posting writes it. `check_letter.py` hard-fails with `NO_COMPANY_IN_POSTING` without it, and the application workspace directory is named from it. |
| `seniority` | enum: `intern / junior / mid / senior / lead` | Infer from title words, years-of-experience stated, and scope of responsibilities. See §2 for implicit seniority signals. |
| `location` | string | The posting's own location text, verbatim and as one string (e.g. "Amsterdam, hybrid", "Remote — EU"). NOT a `{city, country, arrangement}` mapping: no script reads a structured location, and the two shapes travelling between modes is what let assess and apply write mutually incompatible `posting.yaml` files for the same posting. |
| `must_haves[]` | list of strings | Hard requirements the posting marks as required, essential, must-have, or minimum. Include degrees/certs if stated as required (not just "preferred"). See §2 for phrasing heuristics. |
| `nice_to_haves[]` | list of strings | Skills/experience the posting marks as preferred, bonus, a plus, nice to have, or "we'd love". Include items in a separate "Preferred Qualifications" section. |
| `responsibilities[]` | list of strings | Day-to-day duties — what the person will actually do. Drawn from "What you'll do" / "Responsibilities" / "Day in the life" sections. Use the posting's own phrasing. |
| `keywords[]` | list of strings | **Exact ATS terms** to mirror in the CV and cover letter: tool names, language names, frameworks, methodologies, certifications, domain-specific jargon. Extract casing exactly (e.g. "PyTorch", "CI/CD", "REST APIs", "Agile/Scrum"). |
| `company_values_tone` | string | Culture signals + voice. Note: formal vs. casual writing style, mission language ("we believe", "our north star"), DEI statements, pace signals ("fast-moving", "startup within a larger company"), team descriptors ("collaborative", "autonomous"). This shapes the cover letter's register. |
| `red_flags` | list of strings | Signals of a problematic role. See the full list of red-flag patterns in §2. |
| `salary_range` | string or null | The stated pay range, if the posting gives one (e.g. "€65k–80k"); else `null`. Many EU/US postings now state a range. |
| `application_type` | enum: `cv / structured` | `structured` when the employer asks for a supporting statement, criterion-by-criterion evidence, a competency response or a structured application form. Essential / Desirable headings or a framework name alone do not establish that requirement. Otherwise `cv`; preserve any explicitly requested CV alongside structured materials. Follow `references/structured-applications.md`. |

**Salary fit (when a range is stated):** if `salary_range` is present, ask the user **once** whether it fits their expectation unless already answered. If no range is stated, keep it unknown; explain that uncertainty when it affects the decision or a stated pay floor. Never invent salary or block the rest of the assessment on an optional salary question.

  "red_flags": []
}
```

## 2. Heuristics for Messy Postings

Real postings are inconsistent, duplicated, and full of noise. Use these rules to produce a clean extraction.

### Mapping phrasing to must_have vs. nice_to_have

| Posting language | Classify as |
|---|---|
| "required", "must have", "essential", "minimum qualifications", "you must" | `must_have` |
| "preferred", "bonus", "a plus", "nice to have", "ideally", "we'd love", "advantageous" | `nice_to_have` |
| "you have…" (declarative, not conditional) in a requirements list | `must_have` |
| "we'd love it if you have…", "bonus points for…" | `nice_to_have` |
| Degree listed in "Minimum Qualifications" | `must_have` |
| Degree listed in "Preferred Qualifications" or "a degree in X is a plus" | `nice_to_have` |
| No qualifier given, but listed alongside clearly hard requirements | Default to `must_have`; note ambiguity |

**Non-English postings:** the cue words above are English; apply the same logic to the local-language equivalents. German: `Erforderlich` / `Voraussetzungen` / `Sie bringen mit` → `must_have`; `Wünschenswert` / `von Vorteil` / `idealerweise` → `nice_to_have`. French: `Exigé` / `Requis` → `must_have`; `Souhaité` / `un plus` → `nice_to_have`. Japanese: `必須` → `must_have`; `歓迎` / `尚可` / `あれば尚可` → `nice_to_have`. Extract `keywords` in the **posting's language** (tool names and proper nouns stay as-is). Record the posting language and carry it to `meta.language` so the CV and letter are written to match (see `cv-craft.md §2`).

### Seniority questions are not unstated must-haves

A "Senior" or "Lead" title does not establish a fixed years-of-experience floor,
management duty or eligibility barrier. Extract only the employer's stated
requirements into `must_haves`. You may suggest confirming expected ownership,
independence or mentoring with the employer; keep those questions separate from
the extracted requirements, coverage denominator and screening verdict. A user's
guess about an employer's expectations does not turn it into a sourced condition.

### Hard disqualifiers (tag separately — they are walls, not wishes)

Some must-haves are **non-negotiable barriers** the candidate cannot close by tailoring or learning: **work authorization / visa** for the country, a **legally required license or security clearance**, a **hard on-site/location** requirement, **language fluency**, or a **regulated experience floor**. Tag these `[disqualifier]` (distinct from an ordinary must-have like "Kubernetes", which is recoverable).

Surface `[disqualifier]` items **first** in the §4 confirmation and ask the user directly: *"These look non-negotiable — do you meet them? If not, this may not be worth a full application."* This protects the user's time on day one (the recruiter judge would otherwise only catch a logistics wall after a whole package is built), and it keeps a genuine legal barrier from being mis-handled downstream as a soft "framing" gap (see `gap-analysis.md §3`).

### Stripping boilerplate

Ignore and do not extract as requirements:
- EEO/EEOC statements ("We are an equal opportunity employer…")
- Legal disclaimers and data-processing notices
- Generic perks lists (health insurance, 401k, office snacks)
- Generic soft-skill padding appearing identically across all roles at a company (e.g. "You are a team player who communicates well")
- Carbon-copy "About the Company" paragraphs that describe the company's history

Keep soft skills that appear in the specific requirements section of *this* posting as likely intentional signals (e.g. "exceptional written communication required for a client-facing role" is real).

### Handling duplicated requirements

Postings often list the same skill in both "Requirements" and "Responsibilities" sections. De-duplicate: keep one entry in the most appropriate field (`must_have` if it was in Requirements, `responsibility` if it was only in Responsibilities).

### Short or incomplete postings

Validate completeness using the fetch procedure below. A concise but complete
posting is usable; a title and search snippet are not its full description.
Extract what the source states. Leave unsupported company size, culture and
requirements unknown; never fill `company_values_tone` from memory or a title.
If a material field is absent, name that uncertainty and its effect on the
decision rather than inventing a value. Ask for missing source text when needed.

### Red-flag patterns to detect

Add to `red_flags[]` if any of these appear:

| Pattern | Example |
|---|---|
| Rockstar/ninja/guru language | "We're looking for a coding ninja" |
| Unpaid or ambiguously paid | "Stipend-based", "equity only at the start" |
| Unrealistic stack breadth | Requires 10+ distinct specialisms at senior level |
| Scope creep signals | "Other duties as assigned" is vague; extreme version: the whole posting is vague |
| Churn / pressure signals | "Move fast", "wear many hats" combined with no stable team description, or former employees' LinkedIn shows <1 year tenures |
| Missing salary range (jurisdiction-dependent) | Red flag in US states/EU contexts where it is required or expected |
| "We're a family" | Boundary-setting risk; common in high-burnout cultures |
| No mention of team structure | Unclear whether IC role exists inside a real team |

---

## 3. The Fetch Procedure

If the user already provided complete posting text, validate that text and proceed
to extraction. Otherwise follow this retrieval order.

**Step 1 — Try to fetch the URL.**

Use `WebFetch` on the provided URL. Examine the returned text:
- Does it identify the specific role and employer and contain substantive duties and requirements?
- Is the description complete rather than a search card, truncated excerpt or access wall?

If yes, proceed to extraction.

**Step 2 — Detect a blocked or unusable page.**

The following platforms frequently return login walls, empty shells, or JavaScript-rendered content that is not usable as text:
- LinkedIn job postings (most return a login prompt or a thin snippet)
- Workday embeds (e.g. `company.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com`) — often return near-empty HTML
- Greenhouse iframes loaded inside a company's own site
- Lever postings embedded in iframes
- Taleo and iCIMS portals

Word count is a warning signal, not a minimum: concise postings and languages
without spaces can still carry complete requirements. A sign-in link beside a
readable description is not a login wall. If the description is actually missing
or truncated, **do not guess**. Use an available reader under
`references/network-recovery.md`, or ask for the full text when access requires
the user's participation.

**Step 3 — Ask the user to paste the full text.**

Say exactly this (adjust as needed):

> The job posting at [URL] is behind a login wall / returned too little text to extract reliably. Please paste the full posting text here and I'll extract the structured schema from it.

Wait for the pasted text. Then extract.

**Step 4 — Extract from the text.**

Apply the schema in §1 and the heuristics in §2. Produce the JSON object internally (the orchestrator uses it downstream). Do not show the raw JSON to the user — show the confirmation summary in §4 instead.

---

## 4. Confirm with the User

After extracting, always show a concise plain-English summary and ask for confirmation before proceeding. Use this format:

---

**Role:** [role_title] at [Company] — [arrangement] in [city / remote]

**Must-haves I extracted:**
1. …
2. …
3. …

**Nice-to-haves I extracted:**
1. …
2. …

**Key ATS keywords I'll mirror:**
[comma-separated list]

**Culture/tone signal:** [one sentence]

**Red flags:** [none / list]

Questions about unstated employer expectations: [list or "none"; not counted as requirements]

---

Does this look right? Please correct anything I got wrong or add context the posting omits (e.g. team size, internal context, whether a requirement is actually negotiable). I'll use your input before moving to gap analysis.

---

This step is not optional. The user often knows:
- That "5 years experience required" is a negotiable guideline, not a hard cutoff
- That the role is actually a different seniority than the title suggests
- That the company cares far more about one skill than the posting implies
- That they have additional relevant experience not yet in the CV

Incorporate all corrections, then proceed to gap analysis.
