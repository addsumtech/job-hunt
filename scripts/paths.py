"""Every filesystem location job-hunt uses, in one module.

The <company>-<role>-<YYYY-MM-DD> workspace shape is load-bearing: the
"resume an in-progress application" lookup finds a prior run by that shape, so
a mode that invents its own layout orphans the previous workspace and
re-interviews the user from scratch with no error anywhere. Changing
`workspace()` changes that behaviour for every mode at once — which is the
point of it living here rather than in four mode files.

These are pure path builders: nothing here touches the disk. A helper that
created directories would materialise an empty workspace on a typo, and the
resume lookup would then find a shell and offer to continue from it.
