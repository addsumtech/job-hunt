"""Whether the shipped tree is free of invisible and BiDi control characters.

A static review of this skill flagged U+00AD in `check_pages.py` and U+202B /
U+202C in a `render_cv.py` comment. Both were legitimate in intent — a hyphen
class that has to ignore the hyphen LaTeX inserts at a line break, and a comment
quoting the Arabic that pdftotext actually returned — and that is the reason this
gate is mechanical rather than a judgement call.

WHY IT MATTERS ANYWAY. U+202E and its siblings change the order a reader sees
without changing what the interpreter reads, so a line can display as one thing
and parse as another (Trojan Source, CVE-2021-42574). U+00AD and the zero-width
family are the same gap in the other direction: a character nobody can see,
inside an identifier, a URL or a regex. This repo asks an agent to read its own
source and documentation and act on them, so a line that reads differently to
the reader than to the machine is a correctness problem here, not only a supply
chain one.

THE REMEDY IS ESCAPE OR REMOVE, NOT DELETE-AND-HOPE. `\\xad` in a regex is the
same pattern with nothing invisible in the file. A comment that needed BiDi
controls to display correctly says so in words instead. There is deliberately no
allowlist: a waiver file is how the next one gets in, and the gate's own fixtures
are built from `chr(cp)` at runtime so it never needs one.

Exit 0 = nothing found. 1 = findings on stdout, one per line. 2 = could not run,
which includes finding no files to read at all — 0 findings over 0 files is how a
gate goes green after a path change.

A REPO-LEVEL CHECK, NOT A WORKSPACE GATE. It takes no --workspace, imports no
journal and writes no receipt, because it reads files that live in this repo
rather than artifacts that live in a user's run; a receipt would be bookkeeping
about nobody. This is the same named exception check_skill_lossless.py and
check_conventions.py --ci carry. The exit codes are the shared ones, so CI and a
local run cannot disagree about a file.
