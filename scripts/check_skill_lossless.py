"""Guard the job-application → job-hunt migration: prove it MOVED content, not deleted it.

"Split it into references" quietly becomes "rewrite and condense": the file
shrinks, the commit says zero information loss, and operational rules are gone.
That regression is invisible in review — the diff is thousands of lines and every
removed line *looks* like it landed somewhere. So make it mechanical. Every
substantive line of the baseline tree must still be findable, verbatim, somewhere
a skill trigger can reach.

    # in CI, against the tag created during the migration
    python3 scripts/check_skill_lossless.py --baseline job-application-baseline

    # against a tree on disk
    python3 scripts/check_skill_lossless.py --baseline /Users/x/.claude/skills/job-application

Exit 0 = every baseline line accounted for. Exit 1 = content was lost, or the
allowlist names a file that is still present. Exit 2 = the baseline could not be
read at all — which is NOT the same answer as "content was lost", and must not
share an exit code with it.

This script is the one deliberate exception to job-hunt's gate contract: it is a
repo-level CI check, takes no --workspace, imports no journal and writes no
receipt. SKILL.md's self-check lists it under CI for that reason.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE — read before quoting a score. It measures whether the
bytes still exist, not whether they reach the context at the moment they are
needed. A refactor can score a perfect result and still degrade the skill,
because the regression is in *when* content arrives, not *whether* it survives.
Content preservation is necessary and nowhere near sufficient; the only real test
of a layering change is running the skill end-to-end afterwards and looking at
what the output is missing.

Matching is deliberately forgiving about FORM and strict about SUBSTANCE. Text is
NFKC-folded, dashes and smart quotes unified, punctuation dropped, case ignored,
and the whole corpus joined into one string before matching — so a line may be
re-wrapped, re-indented, moved to another file, or have its bullet marker changed
and still pass. What it may not do is lose a word.

Deliberate deletions are legitimate. Record them in the allowlist with a reason:
`waived` for individual lines (keyed on a hash of the normalized line, so editing
the line revokes its waiver), `deleted_files` for whole files. Adapted from
slides_maker's scripts/check_skill_lossless.py.
