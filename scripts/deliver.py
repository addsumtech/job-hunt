"""Deliver a client consultation report and requested application documents.

Default destination: ~/Downloads/<workspace-name>/. Use the same explicit --to
folder for all workspaces answering one consultation: a manifest in that folder
records which workspace and mode wrote each file, so a second workspace (or a
second mode of the same workspace) goes to its own subfolder instead of
overwriting the first, and a redelivery removes its own files that it no longer
produces. Client files no manifest accounts for (an older deliver.py wrote none)
count as another workspace's unless they match this round byte-for-byte or the
folder is this workspace's default one. Internal audit artifacts stay in the workspace. A report PDF is
required unless --no-pdf is explicitly requested; CV and letter PDFs are copied
from their renderers' output, never converted from Markdown here. Exit 2 means
incomplete delivery; never call that complete. The last line names the folder
the files actually went to.
