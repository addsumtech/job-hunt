"""Gate: the rendered PDF is as long as the market says it may be — and it still
says who the candidate is and where they worked.

Nothing else in the pipeline measures the artifact that is actually submitted.
The three judges read `cv.md`; `render_cv.py` reports success on any compile that
returns 0; and `references/cv-craft.md:224-228` states a hard length table that no
program has ever checked. A three-page CV for a five-year candidate renders
perfectly, passes every existing gate, and is a common silent screen-out.

The text-coverage half was added after a measured defect of the same shape: the
renderer emitted a pdfLaTeX preamble for a XeTeX engine, every character above
Latin-1 was dropped with an exit-0 warning, and `Łukasz Wójcik` reached recruiters
as `ukasz Wójcik`. `cv.md` was intact, so all three judges saw the right name. The
renderer now fails on those warnings, but this gate is the independent check on
the delivered bytes: a CV whose PDF does not contain the candidate's own name is
the one thing worth asserting mechanically.

Exit 0 = within budget and readable. Exit 1 = findings. Exit 2 = no PDF to measure.

# ── PDF text extraction ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Dependency-free on purpose: requirements.txt is PyYAML + python-docx, and a gate
# that only runs where poppler or pypdf happens to be installed is a gate that
# reports "clean" by being absent. `pdftotext` is used when it is there, but only
# as a rescue after the built-in reader — see `extract_text`.
#
# What does NOT work, measured: inflating the FlateDecode streams and reading the
# bytes. tectonic writes text as glyph indices into a subset font, so the content
# stream for "Łukasz" contains no letters at all. What works is the /ToUnicode
# CMap the same PDF carries to make itself copy-pasteable: it maps those indices
# back to Unicode. This reads every CMap in the file and decodes the text runs
# with each one in turn, rather than resolving which font each run belongs to —
# that resolution needs the page resource dictionary, which lives inside a
# compressed object stream. Decoding with the wrong CMap yields noise, and noise
# does not accidentally spell a candidate's name, so the union of the decodings is
# a sound thing to search: a needle found in any of them really is in the PDF.
