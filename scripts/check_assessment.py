"""Whether an assessment may be shown to the person who asked for it.

Composes the five checks that stand on their own -- evidence refs, the prediction lint,
the contradiction detectors, the counting path, the market-table lint -- and adds the
rules that only make sense once all five outputs sit in the same document.

Composition means requiring the receipts, not recomputing the answers. A gate that was
never run produces no output, and no output looks exactly like a clean run, so this
gate reads journal.jsonl and refuses to pass when an upstream receipt is missing or
records a failure. It re-derives their logic on top of that as a belt-and-braces check
on the SHIPPED bytes, which is a different question from "did the gate run".

Each added rule closes a way an assessment can be internally consistent and still
wrong: counts without the disclaimer read as a prediction; a hard barrier printed after
the conclusion is a barrier nobody registered; a contradiction found in code and absent
from the page is one the reader averages away; a convention restated by the model is how
a "usually" becomes a "must" with nothing to check it against; a 大概率被筛掉 with no
「那该怎么办」 half is a door closed with nothing behind it.

Two comparisons are deliberately loose, because the tight version fires on correct
output and a gate that cries wolf is a gate people stop reading:

* Conventions are compared with ALL whitespace removed. The tables use YAML block
  scalars with hard wraps; demanding the model reproduce the wrap points would fail a
  card rendered character-for-character.
* Disqualifiers are keyed on the `## 硬性阻断项` section and the ROW IDS it lists, never
  on the posting's own wording. A Chinese section naming an English requirement is a
  paraphrase by construction, and that is the correct output, not the defect.

One finding is deliberately downgraded. check_conventions.py fails hard on an expired
review_by because it is the CI lint and that is where a stale date should stop a build.
Here it becomes WARN_EXPIRED_REVIEW_BY and the card must instead carry a 「已过复核期」
banner (spec §10). A date passing while the code did not change must not stop the skill
working -- but rendering a stale card without saying so is worse than either.

A mode may not claim success without a receipt. Exit 2 writes one too, verdict
"could_not_run", unless the workspace directory itself is absent.
