"""Save a master profile without destroying the ones already there.

One candidate has one CV per language, not one CV. A returning user with an
English master who supplies a Chinese one has TWO masters: a Chinese CV is a
different document with different conventions, length rules and personal-data
expectations, not a translation of the English one. Overwriting is silent data
loss the user discovers only when they next need the file that is gone.

So:

  same language as an existing master  -> overwrite it, after a dated backup
  a language no master covers yet      -> a new file; nothing else is touched
  no `meta.language` at all            -> refused, because the unsuffixed slot
                                          is where a legacy English master
                                          usually lives and dropping an untagged
                                          CV there is exactly the overwrite this
                                          script exists to prevent

**The language comes from the file, never from the filename.** The renderer, the
heading tables and the letter salutations all key off `meta.language`; a filename
reaches none of them, so a `profile.en.yaml` whose content says `zh` is a Chinese
master and is treated as one.

**The legacy slot is resolved, not recomputed.** A user whose only master is
`profile.yaml` with `meta.language: en` gets a NEW English CV written back to
`profile.yaml` — not to a second file called `profile.en.yaml`. Two masters for
one language is the same defect as an overwrite, arriving from the other side.

Exit codes follow the gate contract although this is not a gate: 0 saved,
2 could not run. Never 1.
