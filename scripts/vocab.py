"""Every closed vocabulary in job-hunt, in one module.

A closed set spelled out twice is a closed set that will drift, and the drift
is silent because both copies are individually valid Python. Before this
module existed the five verdicts were hard-coded in five places across the
four mode plans, `MARKET_KEYS` was declared twice with different contents, and
the "no market table" token was `none` in one plan and `other` in two others —
three separate ways for two modules to disagree about a set the design calls
"these exact strings, everywhere".

Import from here. Do not re-declare. If a set genuinely needs to grow, it grows
in this file, and test_vocab.py is what tells you which callers you changed.
