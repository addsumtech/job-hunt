"""The one place a number in an assessment comes from.

The skill this replaces computed must-have coverage twice, with two formulas, over the
same list. The two never agreed, and prose was left managing the disagreement. There is
one function here, one rendered block, and check_assessment.py requires the block in
fit-assessment.md to be byte-identical to what this produces. A second number cannot
survive that.

No percentage, and no slash score. Collapsing strong / partial / gap into one number
needs a weight for a partial match, and any weight would be invented. The block shows
exactly what was counted and claims nothing that was not; every counted row is printed
in the requirement table beside its evidence reference, so the denominator is auditable
row by row and a reader can object to any single line.

Exit 2 still writes a receipt, verdict "could_not_run", unless the workspace directory
itself is absent -- there is nothing to append to.
