"""Parse the three judges' VERDICT blocks into judge-round-<n>.json.

Every agent file ends with "The orchestrator parses this block programmatically
— formatting must be exact", and until now no such program existed: the
orchestrator was a model reading prose. Three things move into code here, and
each of them is a place where a charitable read produces a package that looks
fully reviewed and is not:

  * anything other than exactly PASS or REJECT is AMBIGUOUS, and AMBIGUOUS means
    re-dispatch that judge — fail-closed, never "close enough to a pass";
  * combined PASS requires all three, because each agent file states only its own
    bar and none of them knows it is being ANDed;
  * LEVELING and STANDOUT_SIGNAL are extracted but do not touch the verdict —
    treating them as gates stalls a package that should pass, ignoring them drops
    the highest-value tailoring instruction the loop produces.

Exit 0 = all three returned exactly PASS. Exit 1 = REJECT or AMBIGUOUS (i.e. the
round needs another pass; findings on stdout). Exit 2 = a transcript is missing.

    # "fail" is kept for the parse that produced no usable verdict (AMBIGUOUS /

    # and a round nobody judged would then exit 0 behind an honest-stop.yaml —
    # one silent failure traded for another.

    # hand-write `combined_verdict: "PASS"` into judge-round-2.json, and the
    # package went out over a round the judges had rejected — round 1's receipt
    # vouching for it. Round 1 alone was protected, by MISSING_RECEIPT.
    # Keyed by WORKSPACE-RELATIVE PATH, not by judge name. `input_hashes` is now
    # re-verified against disk by check_apply, and a key like "ats" names no
    # file, so the three judge transcripts — the evidence the whole review loop
    # rests on — would have been the one required gate whose receipt could not be
    # checked. Nothing reads these keys by name (the path-keyed map
    # check_render_freshness uses is a different field, `dispatch.input_hashes`).
    # `stale_round` joins AMBIGUOUS for the same reason: neither produced a
    # usable verdict FOR THIS ROUND. It printed the finding and exited 0 with a
    # "recorded" receipt, so check_apply — which reads that receipt and its round
    # stamp — passed a round nobody judged. That is the bypass the round stamp was
    # added to close, reopened one level up.
