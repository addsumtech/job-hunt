"""Contradictions inside a single assessment, found in code rather than asked for in
prose. Pure, deterministic, and deliberately not the model's job to police.

The mode file already states each of these rules, and the model already follows them
most of the time. That is exactly the problem this file exists for: a rule obeyed most
of the time still ships the defect, and this one ships it invisibly. Nothing about the
top verdict priced at three days looks broken on screen -- it looks like an assessment.
The reader has no way to know the two halves were produced by a model contradicting
itself, so they average them, and the average is not a judgement anyone made.

Every check reports rather than repairs. Code can see that two fields disagree; it
cannot see which one is right, and picking silently would replace a visible
contradiction with an invisible guess.

These are deliberately the checks that survive being wrong. Each fires on a countable
fact, never on meaning, so a false positive costs the reader one line of caution and
never suppresses a finding.

Exit 2 still writes a receipt, verdict "could_not_run", unless the workspace directory
itself is absent -- there is nothing to append to. A clean run's verdict is "recorded":
this script reports, it does not judge, and the composer that reads it --
check_assessment.py, not check_apply.py -- has PASSING_VERDICTS ("pass", "recorded").
"recorded" here means "ran, nothing to report", never "stored a baseline"; the setup
half of a two-step gate is "baseline_recorded". See journal.VERDICTS.
