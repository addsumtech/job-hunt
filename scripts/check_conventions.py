"""Whether a market-conventions table may ship.

These tables carry the one class of assertion in this skill with no source text behind
it, so they are written by a person, dated, provenance-kinded, and rendered verbatim.
Nothing here can check that an entry is TRUE. It checks the things a program can decide,
and every threshold below was calibrated against the forty source entries before it was
chosen -- a gate that cries wolf on the repo's own fixtures is a gate someone
eventually switches off.

references/market-conventions/README.md is this script's spec. If the two disagree, the
README is what a person reads before adding an entry, so fix the script.

EXPIRED_REVIEW_BY is a HARD finding here on purpose: this script is the CI lint, and CI
is where a passed review date is supposed to stop the build. It is NOT hard at runtime --
check_assessment.py re-prefixes it as WARN_ and requires a 「已过复核期」 / "past its review
date" banner instead, because a date passing while the code did not change should not stop
the skill working (spec §10). The two behaviours are deliberate and live in two different
scripts.

Exit 2 still writes a receipt, verdict "could_not_run", unless the workspace directory
itself is absent -- there is nothing to append to.
