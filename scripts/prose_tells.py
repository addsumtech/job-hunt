"""The things that make a CV or a letter read as machine-written.

A library, not a gate. Three gates call it so the surfaces cannot drift apart on
what counts as a tell: `lint_cv.py` (the CV, lexical checks only), `check_letter.py`
(the motivation letter) and `check_word_limits.py` (the supporting statement, per
criterion — the artifact that is actually MARKED in a structured application, since
the three CV judges are routed away from that branch by design).

## What is checked, and why these

Grounded in what recruiters actually report catching in 2026, not in taste:

* **A 2026 lexical set.** `spearheaded`, `pivotal`, `intricate`, `showcasing`,
  `delve`, `realm`, `robust` sit alongside the older `leveraged` / `synergy` /
  `results-driven`. `lint_cv.CLICHES` already held four of them; the rest were
  missing, and they are the ones currently flagged most.
* **Em-dash density.** Language models use em dashes at two to three times the
  human rate, which makes it one of the few tells that is a MEASUREMENT rather
  than an opinion. Flagged by density, never by a single use — a person
  legitimately uses one.
* **The "not just X, but Y" pivot**, and its siblings. A Washington Post analysis
  of 328,744 ChatGPT messages found it to be the model's signature turn. Rare
  enough in a 300-word letter that one occurrence is worth naming.
* **Tricolon density.** "Efficient, effective, and reliable." The rule of three
  is good writing, which is exactly why models apply it to everything; the tell
  is three of them in one short letter, not one.

## What is deliberately NOT checked

**Sentence-length uniformity.** It is the most-cited structural tell and it does
not survive calibration here: a motivation letter is 250–350 words of formal
prose whose sentences are legitimately similar in length, and the measure could
not separate the machine letter below from a human one without firing on both.
A gate that fires on correct output gets switched off, and then it protects
nothing — this repo has closed three of those this week.

**Structural checks on a CV.** A skills line reads "Python, C++, MATLAB" and a
bullet is terse by design, so tricolon and em-dash density would fire on every
correct CV. The lexical set applies to both surfaces; the structural checks are
prose-only.

**The skill's own reader-facing documents** — `shortlist.md`, `fit-assessment.md`,
the completion message. Measured 2026-09-06 across all eight of them in the
iteration-2 with_skill runs: the vocabulary check found ZERO, and every one of the
eight structural findings was a false positive on inspection. In a Chinese
shortlist the em dashes were `——` (ordinary Chinese punctuation) and the `title —
company · city · salary` separator; in a fit-assessment the "tricolons" were
enumerations of real alternatives ("MR, CT or another modality", "colleagues,
documentation or customers") and requirement text quoted from the advert. These
documents are tables and lists, not 300 words of connected persuasive prose, so
`prose_findings` does not transfer to them and must not be wired into
`check_shortlist` or `check_assessment`. What governs their prose is
`SKILL.md`, "How this skill writes to the user" — a rule set, because nothing here
can measure it.

**Anything in a language the check has not been taught.** The weak-opener list in
`lint_cv.py` carries the scar: it was English-only, so four Chinese bullets
opening 负责 produced nothing while the German `Verantwortlich` fired, and the
lint was enforcing a style rule on one alphabet. A tell that is only known in
English is reported as English-only rather than pretended to be universal.
