"""Cut the posting and the CV into addressable evidence blocks.

Port of marketfit-job-lens src/ai/evidenceBlocks.js. The parameters are fixed by the
skill's shared contract and are load-bearing: 900 characters per block, 80 blocks per
source, split on blank lines or a newline before a bullet / number / CJK numeral,
sentence-split over-long paragraphs on [。.!?], drop chunks under 8 characters.

Why blocks exist: every analytical sentence in an assessment must point at text that
really exists. That is a plausibility bound, not a proof -- it guarantees a claim
points at something real, never that the claim follows from it. Carry that sentence
into the skill's own output; a reader who mistakes it for proof is worse off than one
who was told nothing.

HOW LOOSE THAT BOUND IS DEPENDS ON THE DOCUMENT, AND IT IS LOOSEST EXACTLY WHERE A
POSTING IS SHORT. Paragraphs are packed up to the 900-character ceiling rather than
kept one-per-block, so a small source collapses into very few blocks. Measured
2026-08-10 on a realistic 1502-character posting: TWO blocks, the first 872 characters
covering the title, every must-have and every nice-to-have. A row citing JD-001 for
"PhD required" is then pointing at a slab that also contains the language preference
and the publication venues -- the citation resolves, and localises almost nothing.
This is faithful to the port (marketfit packs identically) and the parameters are
fixed by the shared contract, so it is a recorded limit rather than a bug to fix here.
What follows from it: on a short posting the block reference is close to worthless as
localisation, and the requirement row's own quoted wording is what a reader must
actually check. Do not let a resolving reference stand in for having read the text.

Every length here is counted in CHARACTERS. Not bytes, and not latin display columns.
A nine-character Chinese line is a real line; measuring it in bytes would keep junk and
measuring it in latin width would silently delete a third of a Chinese posting.

Exit 2 still writes a receipt, verdict "could_not_run". The single exception is a
workspace directory that does not exist: there is nothing to append to, and creating it
would leave a journal for a run that never happened, so that case exits 2 silently in
the journal and loudly on stderr.
