"""Record entering a mode, and the exact bytes of the mode file that was loaded.

modes/*.md is layer 1.5: loaded unconditionally on entering the mode, not "if
relevant". That distinction is only real if something reports its absence — a
reference file skipped is a silent deletion, which is the failure this whole
layering exists to avoid. So the mode's own gate requires this record, and
requires the hash to still match the file on disk.

Exit 0 = entered. Exit 2 = the mode file does not exist; a `mode_entry_failed`
record is written first, because a failed entry that left no trace looks exactly
like an entry nobody attempted — the same silence the record exists to break.

Exit 2 also, and with NOTHING written, when the WORKSPACE does not exist. This
script does not create it. paths.py and four separate gates carry the same
sentence about why — "a helper that created directories would materialise an
empty workspace on a typo, and the resume lookup would then find a shell" — and
this was the one script that defeated it, because journal.append() mkdirs. One
mistyped --workspace left a directory holding a single mode_entry line, which
`paths.workspace()`'s <company>-<role>-<date> lookup then finds by shape and
offers to resume from. Make the directory first; the mode files say so.

Usage: mkdir -p W && python3 scripts/enter_mode.py --workspace W --mode apply
