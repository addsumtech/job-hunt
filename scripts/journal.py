"""The append-only run journal, the receipt every gate leaves in it, and the one
reader that keeps a malformed input file from skipping both.

Risk-register #12: a gate that was skipped produces no output, and no output
looks exactly like a clean run. So each gate writes one receipt here before it
exits — on every exit path, including the "could not run" one — and a mode may
not claim success without quoting its receipts. The receipt carries the hashes
of what the gate actually read, so "the gate passed" is a claim about specific
bytes rather than about a moment in time.

`load_yaml` lives here rather than in paths.py because it exists FOR that
contract, not as a general YAML utility: its whole job is to turn the three ways
a file can be unusable into the could-not-run receipt above. paths.py is pure
path arithmetic and says so; a reader who found a file-parsing function there
would reasonably conclude the two modules were interchangeable.

    journal saw nothing, and check_apply — whose whole composition rule is reading
    those receipts — saw a gate that never ran. The one state the journal exists to

    An empty or comment-only file is NOT one of those: it yields the empty mapping
    (or list), which is what every call site's `or {}` meant and what the callers
    downstream are written against.

    The caller catches YamlUnreadable and routes it to its own cannot_run / exit-2
