"""Render a canonical profile.yaml to Markdown / .docx / PDF (via LaTeX).

Usage:
  python render_cv.py PROFILE.yaml --format md|docx|pdf --out OUTPATH

Three things this renderer is opinionated about, because they materially affect
how a CV reads:

1. Links show a friendly label ("Google Scholar", "GitHub"), never a raw URL.
   A naked `scholar.google.com/citations?user=AbC123` is noise to a human eye;
   the label carries the meaning and the URL rides underneath as the hyperlink
   target (and stays recoverable in the Markdown source / docx relationship for
   any ATS that strips links). See `link_label`.

2. Section order adapts to the candidate. A PhD/researcher or current student
   leads with Education (their primary credential); everyone else leads with
   Experience. `meta.section_order` overrides the heuristic entirely. See
   `section_order`.

3. A PDF always leaves its `.tex` source next to it, so the candidate can hand-
   tune typography or recompile later without rerunning this tool.

    number", `%` starts a comment, `_`/`&`/`~` are special, and spaces end the

    hostile character at once instead of one class at a time, and it makes the

    This is the fix for the defect that shipped a recruiter a CV missing letters
    out of the candidate's own name. The preamble has to match the engine that
    will compile it, because that is what decides how the bytes are read:

      * tectonic / xelatex / lualatex read the file as Unicode and hand each
        codepoint straight to the font, so they need **fontspec**. Given
        `inputenc`+`fontenc` instead they load an 8-bit T1 font, silently drop
        every glyph it lacks, print `Missing character`, and exit 0.
      * pdflatex needs **inputenc + fontenc**, and with them genuinely does
        handle Latin Extended-A (inputenc composes `Ś` as `\\'S`). Emitting
        fontspec for pdflatex would trade a silent glyph drop for a hard compile
        failure, which is why this is not decided by looking at the text.

    `find_latex_engine` prefers tectonic and `modes/apply.md` tells the user to
    install it, so the Unicode branch is the one taken on a normal machine — and
    it is also what an unknown engine (`None`) gets, since the `.tex` left behind
    when nothing is installed is meant to be compiled with tectonic later.

    One preamble builder, both renderers: render_letter.py had its own copy of
    the pdfLaTeX lines and therefore its own copy of this bug.

# A two-column entry heading, and the reason it is neither a bare `\hfill` nor a
# pair of fixed fractions.
#
# `\textbf{title}, org \hfill meta\\` reaches the right margin only while the whole
# thing fits on one line. Let the title grow and the line wraps; `\hfill` then
# collapses at the break, so the organisation and the location collide and the
# dates orphan onto a line of their own. Measured on a real CV:
#     "... - Cum Laude, Leiden University  Leiden, NL"
#     "2021-09 - 2023-02"
#
# Fixed fractions fix that and cost more than they save. At 0.60/0.38 the dates
# stayed put and headings that had fitted on one line began wrapping three ways
# ("PhD Researcher - Deep Learning for Cardiac MRI / Reconstruction, Leiden
# University Medical Center / (LUMC)"), because the right column was reserved at
# its worst case on every row.
#
# So the right column takes its NATURAL width and the left takes whatever is
# left. `\setbox` measures the metadata, `\dimexpr` subtracts it, and the title
# gets the largest column it can have on that particular row. The metadata is a
# single box, so it cannot wrap or be split from its heading. `\smallskip` is
# what separates one entry from the next: entries used to be joined by a bare
# `\\`, which is a line break, not a gap, so four jobs read as one block.
