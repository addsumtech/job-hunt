"""Gate: the judges must have read the files that are on disk now.

Re-judging a stale cv.md produces a verdict block that is completely valid and
*self-confirming* — the judges hand back the same feedback that was supposedly
just addressed, so the loop looks like it is working while nothing changes. No
timestamp, hash or artifact tied a verdict to the file version it judged, which
is why the per-round order (edit → re-render → re-judge) had no backstop at all.

Two modes, in this order:
  --record FILE...  at dispatch, before the judges are spawned
  (no --record)     after the verdicts arrive; a mismatch voids the round

Exit 0 = fresh / recorded. Exit 1 = stale. Exit 2 = nothing to check.
